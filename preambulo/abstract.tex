    In the last decade, technological advancements have enabled a rise of autonomous robotic applications for military use. With the goal of exploring its potential in surveilling military facilities, the Academia Militar commissioned the development and construction of a functioning prototype of an autonomous vehicle. In this article the traction, steering and braking actuators of such vehicle are addressed. Current research focuses on commercial road vehicle applications where autonomy is the key topic, whereas small, non-professional teams often struggle with a lack of clear vision of the whole project and lax safety procedures.
    %A quad vehicle embedded with an electric battery pack, motors, controllers and mechanical couplers to actuate its traction, steering and braking systems, along with their control and interface mechanism, with a design focus on flexibility and personnel safety is proposed and evaluated. Limitations of the proposed design are identified and solutions proposed.
